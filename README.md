# Partyhack

You get one function and all the HTML you could ever want. Do something
amazing.

## How It Works

I've started with a (mostly) blank html file, some Javascript with a single
print statement, and Jquery. The rest is up to you.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your function/HTML. It can be executed from anywhere you like, as
   long as it doesn't interfere with others' code. Your function's name must
   be the same as your Github username.
3. Submit a pull request

## Rules

* Don't modify other people's code.
* Don't break things that aren't yours.
